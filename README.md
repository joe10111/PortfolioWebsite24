# Joe Centeno's Portfolio
This is the personal portfolio website of Joe Centeno.

## Technologies
This portfolio website was built using the following technologies:

* **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-rendered and statically-generated websites.
* **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.
* **IDX:** A web-based code environment (IDE) that is specifically designed for Next.js development.

Using these technologies, I was able to create a fast, responsive, and user-friendly portfolio website that showcases my skills and experience as a developer.

**IDX** was particularly helpful in streamlining my development workflow. It provided me with a number of features that made it easy to write, build, and test my code all online.
