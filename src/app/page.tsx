              <p className="text-lg mb-4">Welcome! I'm Joseph, a passionate Backend Developer who recently completed The Launch Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. This innovative program designed specifically for young career starters deepened my expertise in C#/.NET object-oriented programming and databases, preparing me to tackle complex software development challenges with modern solutions.</p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">My journey doesn't end with software development; I'm also fervently exploring the realm of game development. Revisiting my foundational skills in C++ from my college days, I'm now engrossed in mastering Unreal Engine 5. My ambition is to blend my technical abilities with creative storytelling, crafting engaging worlds that offer players unique and memorable experiences.</p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-4">Outside of the digital domain, my adventures in the Pacific Northwest's wilderness, time spent with my cats, and the art of coffee brewing enrich my life. These experiences, combined with the invaluable customer service skills I developed as a Starbucks Barista, have shaped my approach to technology and teamwork.</p>
              <p className="text-lg">With a balanced skill set in both C#/.NET for software development and C++ for game creation, I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects in both spheres. I invite you to explore my portfolio further. Let's discuss how we can work together to bring innovative ideas to life.</p>
